Health Record Smart Contract

This Solidity smart contract provides a secure and decentralized way to manage and share patient health records on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows users to create, store, and share health records, which are hashed and recorded on the blockchain. The contract also provides access control features, allowing only the owner of the record to share or transfer ownership of the record.

Features:

- Secure health record storage and management on the Ethereum blockchain
- Access control for health record sharing and ownership transfer
- Easy integration with existing healthcare workflows and systems
- To use this contract, simply deploy it to the Ethereum network and interact with it using a web3-enabled application or the Ethereum command line interface. Full documentation and example code is provided in the "docs" directory of this repository.

Contributions and feedback are welcome! If you find any bugs or issues with the contract, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
